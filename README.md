# Assignment-4

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts focused on basic file operations such as reading, writing, and appending. Each task demonstrates the use of file I/O and error handling techniques in Python.

üìÑ Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
Description:
This task involves reading content from a file named sample.txt. The program opens the file, reads it line by line, and displays each line with its corresponding line number. It also includes error handling to manage the scenario where the file does not exist, ensuring the program exits gracefully with a clear message.

Key Concepts:
File reading using open() with 'r' mode

Line-by-line iteration

Exception handling with try-except

üìù Task 2: Write, Append, and Read a File
Description:
This task allows the user to enter text, which is written to a file named output.txt. It then prompts the user for additional input, which is appended to the same file. Finally, the program reads the file and displays its full content with line numbers.

Key Concepts:
Writing to a file using 'w' mode

Appending to a file using 'a' mode

Reading a file using 'r' mode

User input and output formatting
